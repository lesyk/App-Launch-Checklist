iOS/Android App Launch Checklist. [Source](https://branch.io/resources/app-launch-checklist).

##Tech Prep
###Use Source/Version Control for Your Code

If you aren’t already using source control for your app project, start as soon as possible. This will prove invaluable when you need to release a critical bug fix to v1.0 of your app, after you’ve already been working on v2.0 for a month.

###Use the Latest iOS/Android Features
Apple and Google want to show off the latest features in iOS and Android, so incorporating these into your app will make sure you have the best chance of getting featured.
[iOS](https://developer.apple.com/develop/) | [Android](https://developer.android.com/index.html)

###Enable Deep Linking
Without deep linking, your app is an island cut off from the rest of the online ecosystem. In fact, some of the most powerful, user-friendly experiences you can build in your app rely on deep linking.

###Customize Your Onboarding Flows for Different Users
A user that comes from a shared piece of content and opens your app for the first time should be taken to that content, while a user who discovers your app in the app store should get a different app experience. Use attribution and deep linking to create great experiences for each. Customized onboarding can increase your signup ratio up to 70%.

###Set Up Push Notifications
Push notifications are simultaneously one of the most effective and most dangerous tools at your disposal. You definitely will want to use them for re-engagement, but make sure you have a strategy that won't annoy or alienate your users.

###Implement a Robust In-App Analytics Plan
What metrics will you track, and how will you measure success? How will you attribute your acquisition channels, including incoming traffic and downloads?

##Marketing Prep
###Research and Test Competing Apps
Over 50,000 apps are released every month, and yours must somehow stand out in order to be successful. Are you really adding something unique? What have others done successfully that you can emulate? What mistakes have others made that you can avoid?

###Lay the Groundwork for Getting Featured on the App/Play Store
Being featured on the App/Play Store is a great way to get an initial boost of downloads. However, these are not paid placements and you only get one shot, so make sure your app is ready before you actually pull the trigger.

###Implement Search Engine Optimization for Apps
Did you know 93% of online experiences [still begin with a search engine](https://www.imforza.com/blog/8-seo-stats-that-are-hard-to-ignore/)? SEO is vital for even for mobile-first companies, and the rules of road are a bit different from traditional websites.

###Create and Maintain Social Media Accounts for Your App (Facebook/Twitter)
You want establish a presence for your app on the major social networks ahead of time. Post some feature previews to build interest, and point users to your website landing page to join the waiting list.

###Build a List of Influencers and Bloggers with Your Target Audience
Know who the important people in your app’s field are in advance, so that you can reach out with information about your app.

###Assemble a Press Kit
Have your press kit ready to go in advance, so that you are able to send a copy immediately when needed.

##Pre-Launch
###Start a Beta Program
Early beta users can make or break your app. Among other things, they provide crucial feedback, help you find bugs, and can become the early promoters of your app by giving you reviews on your first day. Where to find them? There are plenty of forums and websites where you can invite friends and family to be your first beta testers; find more in the link below. For those who are building on Android, [you can find resources here](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/3131213?hl=en).

###Test Your User Flows and Prototypes with Potential Customers
Things that seem obvious to you may not be clear to anyone else. Build an interactive mockup and carefully watch new users as they navigate through it.

###Create a Web Landing Page
Use a simple landing page to promote your app prior to launch, and capture potential users’ contact info in a waiting list for your launch announcement. Bonus points if you configure a [Text-Me-The-App feature](https://dev.branch.io/features/text-me-the-app/overview/) that you can easily switch on after the app is released.

###Localize Your App
Anyone can see that a global market has more user and earning potential than a regional one;. Make sure your app is built to support going worldwide. Start early and you'll reap the benefits in revenue and users.

###Read Through Official Submission Checklist Guides
Both Apple and Google provide checklist guides of housekeeping tasks related to launching apps. Spend time to review these.
[iOS](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/AppDistributionGuide/Introduction/Introduction.html) | [Android](https://developer.android.com/distribute/tools/launch-checklist.html)

###Build a Growth Engine with Viral Loops
Map out where you think most of your installs will come from. Do you have website visitors you can convert? Will a customized onboarding help? Can you incorporate methods for the app to promote itself, such as content sharing and referral programs?

##Brownie Points
###Add an In-App Feedback Channel
Nothing kills growth like a low star rating on the App/Play Store, so don’t make reviews the first stop for user feedback or issues. Consider building an easily accessible, in-app feature for users to reach out to you.

###Build a Sustainable Testing Strategy
Not every app will need to invest in a full-scale suite of automated regression tests. However, the surest route to a slew of 1-star reviews is to release an app that crashes. At minimum, make sure you are manually testing your major features on real devices prior to submission.

###Build Flows to Collect User Data for Later Engagement
Around 25% of users only open an app once, and the 90 day retention rate can be as low as 14%. With numbers like these, re-engagement campaigns are crucial and you’ll need some way to contact your users if you want a shot at bringing them back.

###Implement a Crash Reporting Tool
If your app crashes, you need to know about it and have some idea of what to do next.

###Get the Right Measurement and Engagement Tools for Growth
There are literally hundreds of app-centric services in dozens of different categories. Some will be necessary for your app, and some won’t make sense to use (or will only be relevant later). Have an idea of which ones you will need and get them set up prior to launch.

###Add Content Sharing
If your app has content, you probably want users to be able to share it with friends. This can drive viral growth, but you need to make sure your deep linking infrastructure is set up to support it on all platforms.

##Launch Day
###Follow Up with Public Relations (PR)
The press kit you prepared earlier? That list of bloggers and influencers you built? Hopefully you’ve reached out to them and set a few embargoes. Check in with them and remind them when you’re launching and when to announce!

###Get At Least Five 5-Star Reviews as Quickly as Possible
A good average rating is one of the best ways to attract new downloads from users browsing around the store. Start with friends and family, beta users, or even strangers you meet at the local coffee shop or on campus.

###Make Your First Users Feel Special
Doing things to make your users feel special will help bring them back. Think of the initial app experience as a first date — you need to make it personal, light, and interesting.

###Use Paid Ads for a Boost
Paid acquisition will most likely be too expensive to use for ongoing growth. But limited paid campaigns during the first few days can be used to build visibility, which you can leverage into organic downloads.

###Set Up Google Alerts for Your App's Name
You want to know when your app gets mentioned on any website!

###Submit to Product Hunt
Product Hunt is one of the best ways to get an influx of new, tech-savvy users. But you only get one shot, and having a successful Product Hunt launch is an art of its own. Other sites to try include [Beta List](https://betalist.com), [Launching Next](https://www.launchingnext.com), and [Appolocious](http://appolicious.com).

##Post Launch
###Immediately Prepare an App Update
Counter-intuitive as it sounds, you should have an update ready to go almost right away after your launch. Users prefer recently-updated apps, so you don’t want your initial release to sit around getting stale while you prepare a new version.

###Monitor Your App Mentions and Reviews
When you get a poor review (it will eventually happen!), you can often reach out to the reviewer to help resolve any issues. This can be a great way to keep your average rating up.

###Run Video Ads
Video is one of the most engaging formats available. Take advantage of this by creating video ads for your app.
[More](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/app-ads/formats/video-ads)

###Add a Referral Program
User referrals can be a huge growth channel, if implemented correctly. Hiding an ‘Invite’ option deep in your app won’t work here — you need to design your referral program so it makes sense with your broader strategy.

###Improve App Latency and Performance
Mobile users expect quick, responsive app experiences. Make sure you optimize your app to eliminate slowness — if you can’t deliver, users will find someone else who can.

###Repeat
Unless you have a huge marketing budget, start out of the gate with a featured placement, or get a massive viral boost, prepare yourself for a slow start. Your first release isn’t the finish line — it’s the starting block.
